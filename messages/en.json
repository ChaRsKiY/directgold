When you place your online delivery order, you simultaneously instruct GOLDLAGERHAUS AG to transfer the amount of gold required for your desired delivery to GOLDATO Handels GmbH, and GOLDATO Handels GmbH to physically deliver the bar sizes you have selected to your delivery address. The only costs incurred for physical delivery are the denomination surcharges (bar premiums) corresponding to the selected bar sizes and the delivery costs depending on the delivery value and destination. Both cost components can be viewed at any time in our fee table and will be displayed transparently and accurately when you create your online delivery order before you place your order. Only bars of the highest quality, manufactured by LBMA-certified refineries, tested and recognised worldwide, are delivered. If, on the other hand, you have not stored your gold bars in collective storage, but exclusively in your name in individual storage at GOLDLAGERHAUS AG, you also have the option – in addition to the delivery process as with collective storage – of having your specific bars shipped directly from individual storage to your delivery address. In this case, you instruct GOLDLAGERHAUS AG via our transaction platform – specifying the specific bar number stamped on the bars – to deliver them from the LOOMIS high-security warehouse in Zurich/Kloten. All deliveries are, of course, carried out by first-class logistics partners and are fully insured.

        "text5": "The LBMA Gold Price is now the authoritative global reference for gold transactions – both physical and derivative-based – and serves as the basis for trading, settlement and valuation worldwide. However, it refers exclusively to unallocated gold held in certified LBMA vaults in London.",
        "text6": "The Good Delivery Standard",
        "text7": "A \"good delivery\" gold bar or \"standard bar\" weighs nominally 400 troy ounces (approx. 12.44 kg), although the actual weight can vary between 350 and 430 troy ounces. The fineness, manufacturer's mark and bar number are stamped on each bar. The bar number uniquely identifies the individual bar and is entered into a central register by the manufacturer. Good Delivery bars may only be produced by LBMA-certified refineries that are listed on the Good Delivery List. These refineries meet strict requirements in terms of quality, production processes, ethical sourcing and traceability. The international \"Good Delivery\" seal of quality guarantees the authenticity, purity and correct storage of a gold bar. From the day of its manufacture, a Good Delivery bar is stored in vaults recognised and monitored by the LBMA. Every movement is logged, ensuring complete documentation and the integrity of the bars. As a result, buyers accept delivery of a Good Delivery bar directly from the seller's vault without conducting an additional purity test. This system significantly reduces transaction costs and increases the efficiency of precious metal trading. Bars with good delivery status are therefore accepted worldwide and can generally be stored and traded in all certified storage facilities. Good delivery bars are traded as spot gold on the London Bullion Market and settled two business days after the trading day (T+2). All precious metal transactions between clearing members are settled electronically on a net basis by London Precious Metals Clearing Limited (LPMCL). LPMCL is owned and managed by HSBC, ICBC Standard Bank, JP Morgan and UBS. Although settlement takes place in London, it is a global market with participants from all over the world.",

        "text11": "The customer owns specific, numbered bars and is their legal owner. These bars are physically stored separately from the custodian's assets and are fully protected against insolvency. The holdings are documented in a weight list that shows the bar number, gross weight, fineness and fine weight of each bar. Credits or debits are only made when the bars are actually physically moved. Allocated gold thus represents direct ownership and offers the highest level of protection against counterparty risks or system failures.",
        "text12": "Unallocated gold",
        "text13": "Around 95% of global professional gold trading takes place on the basis of unallocated accounts. The customer is only entitled to a certain amount of gold, but not to specific bars. This is a claim against the custodian, similar to a bank deposit, where the account holder is the creditor of the bank. The gold is held in collective holdings and the customer does not own the physical metal. This model is very efficient and liquid, but carries a counterparty risk: if the custodian or bullion house becomes insolvent, the unallocated gold may be lost in part or in full. The system works on the principle of fractional reserve banking, similar to the banking system: only a small proportion of market participants demand physical delivery, which is why banks and bullion houses issue more unallocated credit than they hold physical gold in their vaults. As a result, there are more unallocated claims than there is physical metal actually available. As long as trust remains, the system remains stable; however, a loss of trust or massive demand for delivery can lead to bottlenecks. The customer therefore does not hold ownership, but rather a contractual claim in the form of a debt instrument.",
        "text14": "The LBMA Good Delivery Standards define the weight, purity, marking and origin of bars and ensure their global interchangeability. These standards also form the basis for unallocated trading, as physical delivery in OTC trading only takes place when necessary, while accounting is based on standardised, interchangeable bars. The LBMA gold price therefore refers to these standardised good delivery bars located in LBMA-certified storage facilities in London.",

OTC/total trading volumes: The World Gold Council estimates average gold trading volumes in 2023 at ~US$163 billion/day (OTC ~US$99 billion, futures ~US$62 billion); In Q3 2025, average daily volumes rose to ~US$388 billion.

        "text17": "Estimates of the paper-to-physical ratio – no reliable published figures available: Hardman & Co (Open Letter, January 2020): approx. 5% of paper transfers are physically delivered, the rest remains unallocated Source: Hardman & Co, 2020. BullionStar (2019): estimates of 100:1 to 500:1 (paper to physical) as a critical range Source: BullionStar Blog, 2019. Realistic assessment of coverage: Only part of the physically stored gold is usable, 95% of which is unallocated → ratio of 1:20 to 1:50. In any case, the actual coverage is well below 100%, which highlights the inherent system dependency of unallocated trading.",
        "text18": "Over 90% of international gold trading is based on unallocated structures. These enable efficient market liquidity but carry the risk that many claims will encounter a limited physical basis. Those seeking genuine ownership and security should therefore opt for allocated gold – physically existing, clearly assigned metal. DIRECTGOLD therefore deliberately contrasts with the global unallocated market. Every purchase is fully physically backed and legally owned by the customer. The gold is stored in a certified high-security warehouse. Customers thus own real, allocated property in specific numbered gold bars – not a paper claim. Key message: The LBMA gold price creates transparency and comparability. But it is the combination of LBMA price + physical ownership (allocated gold) that guarantees genuine protection, traceability and value retention – the foundation of the DIRECTGOLD principles."
